# React Nanodegree program: MyReads

This is a project built in React using React Fundamentals (React router, props, states, propTypes, etc.)

## Installation

There are the first steps to get a launched project:

* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* Start the development server with `npm start`

## Backend Server

The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/utils/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods where to fetch data:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query)
```

* query: `<String>`
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important

You can find attached SEARCH_TERMS.md, file that contains the specific words to search and see associated books and authors.
